Update the widget update service so that it won't try to load todays image again if it has already been downloaded

Update the regular app to find the url for images using the new system (this works from 15/07/2012 onwards). This will also need to yse the task based system. 
Anything before the listed date can use the old system. The old system probably could be updated to use the task system as well, it's just a matter of the URL format for the actual calendar page being different, but there was a lot of inconsistencies then so it's probably not worth it)
